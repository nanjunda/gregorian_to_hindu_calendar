## 1. The Two Maps of Time
History is written in the stars, but humanity uses two different "maps" to read it:
- **Tropical Map (Modern/Seasonal)**: Focuses on the Earth's relationship with the Sun. It defines Spring by the Equinox. It is a "Fixed Season" calendar.
- **Sidereal Map (Traditional/Panchanga)**: Focuses on the Earth's relationship with the **Galaxy**. It defines the year by when we return to the exact same stars. 

## 2. The Great Drift (Axial Precession)
Earth wobbles like a slowing top over a 25,800-year cycle.
- **The Gap**: Because of this wobble, the "stars" and the "seasons" slowly move apart.
- **Zodiac Aligner**: Use this 3D module to see the 24° gap (Ayanamsa) between the Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs. You can **Zoom** and **Rotate** to inspect how your Western sign usually differs from your Hindu Rashi.

## 3. The Birthday Time-Machine (v6.0.1)
Why does your birthday change every year? 
- **The 11-Day Gap**: A Lunar year is roughly 11 days shorter than a Solar year. 
- **Timeline Scrubber**: Use the interactive slider (1950-2100) to trace your birthday's drift across the century.
- **Adhika Masa (Leap Month)**: Watch the **Synchronization Meter**. Every ~3 years, the system adds a leap month to "reset" the calendar, ensuring your birthday never drifts into the wrong season!

## 4. Planetary Resonance: The 60-Year Clock
The **Samvatsara** cycle isn't a random list of names; it's a "Great Conjunction."
- **Jupiter (~11.8y)** vs **Saturn (~29.4y)**.
- **5 : 2 Ratio**: Every 60 years, Jupiter completes 5 orbits while Saturn completes 2. They meet at the same point in space, resetting the "60-Year Samvatsara" clock. Use the 3D resonance module to watch this cosmic meeting!

## 5. The Geometry of a "Tithi"
A "Lunar Day" (Tithi) is not a 24-hour clock—it's an **angle**.
- Every **12°** of separation between the Sun and Moon creates one Tithi.
- Use the **Tithi Phase Protractor** to see why a lunar day can be longer or shorter than a standard 24-hour day.

## 6. The Shadow Points (Rahu & Ketu)
Rahu and Ketu are not planets; they are the **Lunar Nodes**.
- These are the specific mathematical points where the Moon's tilted orbit crosses the Earth's path. 
- In the 3D **Lunar Nodes Simulator**, you can see why Eclipses only happen when the Moon hits these specific "high-traffic" zones.
