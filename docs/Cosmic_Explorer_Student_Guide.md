## 1. The Two Maps of Time
History is written in the stars, but humanity uses two different "maps" to read it:
- **Tropical Map (Modern/Seasonal)**: Focuses on the Earth's relationship with the Sun. It defines Spring by the Equinox. It is a "Fixed Season" calendar.
- **Sidereal Map (Traditional/Panchanga)**: Focuses on the Earth's relationship with the **Galaxy**. It defines the year by when we return to the exact same stars. 

## 2. The Great Drift (Axial Precession)
Earth wobbles like a slowing top over a 25,800-year cycle.
- **The Gap**: Because of this wobble, the "stars" and the "seasons" slowly move apart.
- **Zodiac Aligner**: Use this 3D module to see the 24° gap (Ayanamsa) between the Tropical and Sidereal zodiacs. You can **Zoom** and **Rotate** to inspect how your Western sign usually differs from your Hindu Rashi.

## 3. The Birthday Time-Machine (v6.0.1)
Why does your birthday change every year? 
- **The 11-Day Gap**: A Lunar year is roughly 11 days shorter than a Solar year. 
- **Timeline Scrubber**: Use the interactive slider (1950-2100) to trace your birthday's drift across the century.
- **Adhika Masa (Leap Month)**: Watch the **Synchronization Meter**. Every ~3 years, the system adds a leap month to "reset" the calendar, ensuring your birthday never drifts into the wrong season!

## 4. Planetary Resonance: The 60-Year Clock
The **Samvatsara** cycle isn't a random list of names; it's a "Great Conjunction."
- **Jupiter (~11.8y)** vs **Saturn (~29.4y)**.
- **5 : 2 Ratio**: Every 60 years, Jupiter completes 5 orbits while Saturn completes 2. They meet at the same point in space, resetting the "60-Year Samvatsara" clock. Use the 3D resonance module to watch this cosmic meeting!

## 5. The Geometry of a "Tithi"
A "Lunar Day" (Tithi) is not a 24-hour clock—it's an **angle**.
- Every **12°** of separation between the Sun and Moon creates one Tithi.
- Use the **Tithi Phase Protractor** to see why a lunar day can be longer or shorter than a standard 24-hour day.

## 6. The Shadow Points (Rahu & Ketu)
Rahu and Ketu are not planets; they are the **Lunar Nodes**.
- These are the specific mathematical points where the Moon's tilted orbit crosses the Earth's path. 
- In the 3D **Lunar Nodes Simulator**, you can see why Eclipses only happen when the Moon hits these specific "high-traffic" zones.

## 8. Two Ways to Measure a Month
In the Hindu system, a "Month" (Masa) isn't just one thing. It's a relationship between the Sun and the Moon.

### The Cosmic Race Analogy
Imagine the Sun and Moon are runners on a track (the Zodiac).
1.  **The Solar Runner (Saura Mana)**: The Sun is steady. It spends about **30 days** in each sign. When it crosses the finish line into a new sign (e.g., Aries/Mesha), a new Solar Month begins.
    *   *Used for:* Harvest festivals like Pongal and Baisakhi.
2.  **The Lunar Sprinter (Chandra Mana)**: The Moon is fast! It laps the zodiac in just **27 days** but takes **29.5 days** to go from New Moon to New Moon.
    *   *Used for:* Most festivals like Diwali and Holi.

### The Naming Secret
How do they get their names?
*   **Solar Names**: Named after the Sign the Sun enters (e.g., **Mesha** Masa).
*   **Lunar Names**: Named after the Star (Nakshatra) the Moon is near when it is **FULL**.
    *   *Example 1:* If the Full Moon is near the star **Chitta** (Spica), the month is **Chaitra**.
    *   *Example 2:* If the Full Moon is near **Krittika** (Pleiades), the month is **Karthika**.

### The Pit Stop (Adhik Masa)
Because the Lunar Sprinter is faster, it finishes its year in ~354 days (11 days early!). To keep the runners together, the Lunar calendar takes a **"Pit Stop"** (Adhik Masa / Extra Month) every ~3 years to let the Sun catch up.

## 9. Live Scientific Support: Chat with the Maestro
Need help navigating the simulation? Or want to know more about a specific star?
- **Floating Chat Widget**: Look for the ✨ icon in the bottom-right corner.
- **Expert Guidance**: The **Maestro** is an AI science educator integrated directly into the app. You can ask him functional questions like *"Where do I find the Moons phases?"* or deep scientific questions like *"Why is Rahu called a ghost planet?"*
- **App Support**: If you get stuck or a simulation isn't loading, the Maestro can guide you through the interface.

## 10. The Official Calendar vs. The Sky Calendar
The **"Saka Varsha"** (Saka Era) shown on the dashboard is the **Official Civil Calendar** of India. It is different from the **Samvatsara** (Sky Calendar) used for festivals.

### The Two Clocks:
1.  **Civil Time (Saka Era)**: 
    *   **Purpose**: Administration (Taxes, Banking, Government Gazettes).
    *   **Type**: Purely **Solar**. It ignores the Moon phases.
    *   **Origin**: Started in **78 AD** (King Shalivahana's Era).
    *   **Math**: It is exactly 78 years behind the Western Calendar (e.g., 2026 - 78 = 1948).
2.  **Cosmic Time (Samvatsara)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Agriculture and Nature (Tides, Seasons, Harvests).
    *   **Type**: **Luni-Solar**. It weaves the Sun and Moon together.
    *   **Origin**: The 60-year resonance of Jupiter and Saturn.

*Think of Saka as the "Office Clock" and Samvatsara as the "Nature Clock."*
